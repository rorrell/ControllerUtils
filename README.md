# ControllerUtils
Utility library of classes that are useful when programming JavaFX (especially controllers)

I created this after building a couple of desktop JavaFX applications and realizing I was doing some of the same things over and over again.

Key Features:

-The ability to change scenes on a single stage.
-The ability to pass parameters between controllers.
-A custom table cell to render clickable hyperlinks.
